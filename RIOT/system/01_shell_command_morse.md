# String to Morse parser

- difficulty: mid
- complexity: low

## Description

The objective of this exercise is to implement a RIOT shell command handler
which parses input strings to Morse signals expressed via LED.

## Instructions

1. Get familiar with the shell using \[1\] and the timer module xtimer \[2\].
2. Program a shell command handler that parses strings to Morse code \[3\]. Note
that you don't necessarily need a board for development. You can also
develop under native \[4\] as there is an LED abstraction.
3. Generate a new module with your code under *RIOT/drivers* which can be included
via Makefile.

Document _all_ your actions and findings. Create an archive with your solution.
