# Document Tests

- difficulty: very low
- complexity: very low

## Description

The objective of this exercise is to extend existing documentation or add new
documentation to the tests in RIOT/tests/ \[1\] in form of `README.md` files.

## Instructions

1. Inspect current `README.md` files in `RIOT/tests`
2. If a test does not contain a `README.md`, then this could be a good candidate
3. Pick a `README.md` that contains vague descriptions and enhance it
4. Provide a Pull Request to the official RIOT \[2\] repository.
