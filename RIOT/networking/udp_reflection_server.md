# Simple UDP Reflection Server

- difficulty: low
- complexity: low


## Description

The objective of this exercise is to get familiar with networking in RIOT and the timer API by implementing a UDP reflection server.

The server should be implemented on RIOT native.
RIOT native allows you to run RIOT as a Linux process, without needing special IoT hardware.

## Instructions

1. Implement a simple UDP echo server in RIOT, which replies any UDP packet the server receives.

2. As a simple extension, the server delays the reply by one second.
